AthenaSquare Frontend Assignment
Task:
In this assignment, you have to create a ReactJS-based web page, in which you will be replicating the section as displayed in the video clip from the official website of kula.ai, which you will find attached in the mail. You just need to create a section of the website as shown in the below image and also shown in the video. Your website should look exactly like this, with just one section, and when we scroll on this action, animation happens. Please see the kula.ai website for more details.

Note: If the video doesnâ€™t play in the browser, download it and play it locally.

You have to replicate the experience, animation, and design as shown in the video. You can assume the dimensions for the design and components inside it 
yourself. You just need to build this specific website section as shown in the sample task video.


Instructions to be followed strictly:
As you can see clearly in the video. We have text on the left side of the section shown in the image and video. So we are sharing the API for getting the text and you need to replace the text you will get from the API. In other terms, you need to integrate API to get the text shown in the task video.

The right section of the video is an animation consisting of 3 videos. So here we are sharing the link to all three videos that you have to use to create that animation.
